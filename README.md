# Test-1
      > This Test-1 project Contain 3 files
      > I am using merge sort Algorith and Heap sort Algorith to solve this problem(Test1 Problem).
      > At the time of final output file generation I am using Heap Sort because its memory usage is minimal because apart from what is necessary to hold the initial list         of items to be sorted, it needs no additional memory space to work.
      > I am using Merge Sort because It is quicker for larger lists, merge sort uses the technique of divide, conquer and combine, It can be applied to files of any size.

# 1. Part-1 (File Splitter)
      This file contain the code to split functionality of 1 large file to small files.
      
# 2. Part-2 
     This file contains the code to read all files from directory and sort all data and update old data with new sorted data.

# 3. Part-3
      This file contains the final code, this code for reading all files from directory and read every files first index value then sort it using heap sort then store
      in array after this save array in final txt final.
      The same condition will repeat untill the every item will read from files.
